# 🥥 Bangalore Lang (BLR)

> **Note:** I built this purely because I was bored and thought Python needed more "Area" energy. Don't use this for production code unless you want your manager to pop you.

## What is this?

**Bangalore Lang** is a Python wrapper that replaces boring keywords with peak Bangalore meme slang. It allows you to write code that sounds like a heated argument in Indiranagar.

Instead of `print`, you say `tell_da`. Instead of `if`, you say `yaavuh`.

It runs on top of Python, so you have access to all standard Python libraries—just with better syntax.

## 📜 The Dictionary

Here is the translation map you need to know to survive in this codebase:

| Standard Python | Bangalore Lang     | Example Usage            |
| :-------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------- |
| `import`        | **`come_to_area`** | `come_to_area math`      |
| `def`           | **`put_scene`**    | `put_scene my_func():`   |
| `print`         | **`tell_da`**      | `tell_da("Hello Macha")` |
| `if`            | **`yaavuh`**       | `yaavuh x > 10:`         |
| `elif`          | **`or_what`**      | `or_what x == 5:`        |
| `else`          | **`otherwise`**    | `otherwise:`             |
| `for`           | **`one_by_one`**   | `one_by_one i in list:`  |
| `break`         | **`cut_ra`**       | `cut_ra`                 |
| `None`          | **`full_waste`**   | `return full_waste`      |
